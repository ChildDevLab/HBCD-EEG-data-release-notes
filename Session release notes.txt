For the March public data release, EEG recordings will not include the impedances and electrodes files. These will be released in a future interim release. If you have questions about this, please reach out to eegdata@umd.edu.

A number of raw .set EEG files have been released with HBCD EEG data but should be excluded from analyses. 

These .set files have been corrupted and will not open with EEGLAB: 
- sub-6829415076: FACE, MMN, RS
- sub-8304538582: RS
- sub-3354133883: RS

These .set files have user errors that resulted in failure during MADE pre-processing: 
- sub-4336352944: FACE
- sub-8650532016: MMN

Additionally, we've identified an artifact related to the stim tracker pulse in the dataset for the ID below. Analyses with this ID should avoid electrode E55, as the artifact is most pronounced in this and the surrounding electrodes. {note Jess's document}
- sub-1248914553: FACE, MMN, VEP
