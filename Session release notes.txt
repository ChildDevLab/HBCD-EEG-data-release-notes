For the March public data release, EEG recordings will not include the impedances and electrodes files. These will be released in a future interim release. If you have questions about this, please reach out to eegdata@umd.edu.

Additionally, we've identified an artifact related to the stim tracker pulse in the dataset for the ID below. Analyses with this ID should avoid electrode E55, as the artifact is most pronounced in this and the surrounding electrodes. {note Jess's document}
