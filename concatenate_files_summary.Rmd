Load in your paths:
directory_path is where you have saved your summary stats or trial measures data (the folder where the original data is downloaded to)
output_path is where you would like the outputs to get saved
```{r}
#SM set to the location you downloaded the EEG files to. If you are using a Windows computer, you will need to change the direction of the slashes from '\' to '/'
```

set cwd (current working directory) to file path, get a list of IDs
```{r}
setwd(directory_path) 
cwd <- directory_path
dccids <- list.files()
```

create sheets - these are the sheets this script will output
```{r}
RS_power <- NULL
VEP_ERP <- NULL
MMN_ERP <- NULL
FACE_ERP <- NULL
```

for each folder (ID), pull summary stats by task and condition
There is one chunk for each task 

RS: 
```{r}
#for x (each ID), pull out the RS summary stats data and paste it into a new sheet, storing ID in a new column
for (x in dccids) {
  processed_data <- paste(x, "/ses-V03/eeg/processed_data", sep="")
 
  RS_power_file <- paste(cwd, processed_data, "/", x, "_ses-V03_task-RS_powerSummaryStats.csv", sep="")
  if (file.exists(RS_power_file)) {
    RS_power_sheet <- read.csv(RS_power_file)
    for (i in 1:nrow(RS_power_sheet)) {
      RS_power_sheet <- RS_power_sheet %>%
        rename(SME_oz = 2, 
               Mean_Power_oz = 3)
      row <- RS_power_sheet[i, , drop = FALSE]
      RS_power <- rbind(RS_power, row)
